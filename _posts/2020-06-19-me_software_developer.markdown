Who would have thought? If you asked me this a few years ago, I must've thought you're joking. But here I am! Not that I have any strong feeling against it, it had just never occured to me that I could do it. Long story short, I was quite happily working for one of the coolest chocolate independent brands. We were about to plan for our brand 10-year anniversary for next year and then BAM! the pandemic. So after a few months of struggling, the owner has decided to close down the brand for good. Honestly, it has hit me harder than I thought. I think it's also because of what's happening right now. Life is constantly changing I think we all can agree to this, especially in the past few months. It was hard to motivate myself out of bed everyday so my husband encouraged me to give freeCodeCamp a go. Before all of this happened, I managed the company's website via squarespace though and have took a SEO course. I started to find it fascinating to understand how websites work underneath and fortunately, my husband is a developer. So long story short, after 2 months of learning html, css and basic javascrip on fcc, here I am writing my first blog post as an aspiring full-stack developer.
