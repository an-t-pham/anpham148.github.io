I've chosen API over scrapping data for my project because I think realistically every website's layout would be changed  or modified over time and my gem would definitely not work at that point. And honestly, I'm also not a big fan of scrapping. Therefore, I've googled which API data is available and pick a topic of my interest from there. That's how I ended up with my cocktail maker project. I'm actually very happy with this topic because I used to make cocktails a lot in the weekend. With this topic, I immediately know what I want to do with this. I would like to search for cocktail recipes by name or by ingredient or getting a suprised one would be great. 

My first problem was to layout what classes do I want for my project. When I summited the plan, I only went with the basics including API class, CLI class and Cocktail class. I didn't realise that I need a Menu class which actually is the most important part of my gem until I actually started to code; because I didn't realise ... well, martini isn't just a martini cocktail. There are dry martini, abbey martini or cosmpollitan martini so turned out there are so many sub-menus.

Another problem for me was to name the methods and variables. I know that most of the variables are local but it felt a bit strange to keep naming them same like the_cocktail or final_cocktail or result ... and for methods I actually changed their name half way as I thought... oh the name I used initially for that one is now more approriate for this one that I just created. It was a nightmare to change the class method's name which has been used in other classes. Then I realized that cmd + F which has helped me massively. 

My main problem of coding (not just from this project) is that sometimes I've tried to write too many functions within 1 method. I've been aware of it, especially while doing this project so I tried to break down functions for each individual method. Though there are still a lot of improvements that I can do for this project, I'm pretty proud of it and I've learned a lot. I feel more confidient to develop my coding skills in future projects.
