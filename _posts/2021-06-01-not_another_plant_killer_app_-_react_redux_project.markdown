Wow! It has been a long ride. I finally finished my final project with Flatiron School. I've got to admit that this project took me way longer than I expected. At first, I had a bigger plan for my Plant App. I thought I could cooperate my app with google calendar to remind users when to water their plants. Well, this idea came from how horrible I am to keep a single plant alive (yup, even succulent). However, after a few weeks of struggling to understand and get used to React components/ syntax, Redux store, hooks and how everything works together. I've decided to scale down my project to focus on the bare bones of my application which will show all the information of plants, create collections and add plant to them. I've used third party - auth0 for authentication and material UI for styling. 

I've just started to understand Hooks more thanks to auth0.  Hooks was introduced in React 16.8, they let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. To be honest, my app is still between Hooks and data fetching in ComponentDidMount. I've used normal state to handleOpen and handleClose my forms if it's class component and I've tried useState hooks for some functional components. I also had to use hooks for auth0 to collect user and some functions they provide. 

Anyways, I also struggled with the way the app fetching data and still have a few bugs after editing or deleting plants from collections. I've learned to not just fetch data in the main app that I need but sometimes also need to re-fetch in some other components. 

All in all,  I'm super proud of my full-stack app (with Rails Api and front end react). I'm also glad that I technically finish the course. It's a bit way overdue but at least I'm here. So next step is the job hunt! I can't wait!
